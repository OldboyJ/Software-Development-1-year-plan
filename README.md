## Three reasons that have made it hard for me to choose to write/try to write code in so long.

1. First reason is feeling discouraged.

2. The realization that because I haven't coded anything in so long that I must review many things all over again makes it discouraging.

3. Not feeling confident in making mistakes. More importantly NOT learning from them.


## Three reasons why I want to write code for a living or hobby.

1. I find computer coding to be fun and much like solving a puzzle.

2. I want to create something exciting of my own or improve somebody else's idea.

3. I want to pursue a career that involves coding at some capacity because I understand that knowing a computer language will open doors for my children in the future.

## What do I need that is or isn't in my control.

1. I need to create a routine and stick with it for better or worse. I cannot continue to keep myself down and stagnant every time I experience some setback.
I need to surround myself with helpful people not necessarily other beginners or experts, but more importantly people that understand the beginners point of view. Also, I would like to challenge myself to teach others what I know with the purpose of solidifying concepts myself.
